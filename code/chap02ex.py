Write a function called Mode that takes a Hist and returns the most frequent value.

As a more challenging exercise, write a function called AllModes
that returns a list of value-frequency pairs in descending order of frequency.

Using the variable totalwgt_lb, nvestigate whether first ba- bies are lighter or
heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups.
How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?
